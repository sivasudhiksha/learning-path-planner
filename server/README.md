Learning Path Planner
📌 Project Description

The Learning Path Planner is a web-based application designed to help users organize and track their learning journey through structured and personalized learning paths. It enables learners to break goals into modules, monitor progress, and stay consistent. The platform is built using the MERN stack for scalability and efficient data management.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js, HTML, CSS

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB

Version Control: Git & GitHub

Design Tools: Figma / Draw.io

🔍 Tech Stack Justification

The MERN stack is chosen to enable full-stack development using JavaScript across both frontend and backend. React provides a responsive and component-based user interface, Node.js and Express.js handle scalable RESTful APIs, and MongoDB offers flexible data storage suitable for dynamic learning paths and progress tracking.

🏗️ System Architecture

The Learning Path Planner follows a client-server architecture. The React frontend manages user interactions and communicates with the backend through REST APIs. The Node.js and Express backend processes requests, applies business logic, and interacts with MongoDB to store and retrieve user, learning path, and progress data.

🗄️ Database Design

The database is designed to efficiently manage users, learning paths, modules, and progress tracking.

Entities:

User: Stores user authentication and profile details

LearningPath: Represents a structured learning roadmap

Module: Individual learning units within a learning path

Progress: Tracks user completion status of modules

Relationships are established to associate users with learning paths and track progress across modules.

🎨 UI/UX Design & Wireframes

The UI is designed with simplicity and usability in mind. Wireframes are created to represent the user journey across key pages such as Login, Dashboard, Learning Path View, and Progress Tracker. A clean and minimal theme is used to enhance focus and readability.
